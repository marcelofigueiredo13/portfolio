In this repository, it's possible to check some off the amazing stuff I developed during my studies and also some personal projects :)
Most of the projects won't work out of the box. If you have any question about it, please reach out.
The projects I would like to stand out are the Mobile App that was developed in Java that is integrated with the Website + API, and deployed in the cloud. Another interesting project that's of my personal interest is the Database developed using PostgreSQL.
