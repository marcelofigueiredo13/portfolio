# portfolio

In this repository, it's possible to see some projects carried out during my studies.
Some of the projects are not complete, therefore they won't work properly.
The projects i would stand out are the third one, that's made in C/C++ oriented to Arduino, where i also used Processing, the database developed in PostgreSQL, and last but not least, the Java project that involved testing using JUnit.
