In this repository, it's possible to see some projects carried out during my studies.
Some of the projects are not complete, therefore they won't work properly.
The biggest and more complete project in this repository includes de API and the Mobile App developed, which are integrated togheter with an database via AWS.
Other projects i would stand out are the third one, that's made in C/C++ oriented to Arduino, where i also used Processing, the database developed in PostgreSQL, and last but not least, the Java project that involved testing using JUnit.
